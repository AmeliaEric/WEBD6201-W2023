    <br><br>My second piece of media is Mama Mia cause the classics don't die. I spent my entire childhood (and into my adult years) with Mia as\
    my nickname cause this movie is all I wanted to watch on my birthday every year. ABBA has my heart and singing/dancing along to dancing queen\
    will forever make me feel 17 again.<br><br> Lastly for my media choices, we have the new Elvis movie because holly molly Austin Butler is handsome...and ya know..sounds like Elvis\
    . My grandfather's Elvis records got passed down to me when he passed away, so I took a history of pop music class to learn more about the King of Rock himself\
    and this movie came out during the middle of that class. It is such a perfect movie down to every detail that it should be everyones favuorite movie.";
